## Firmware
I currently run ZMK on this board. My config and layout can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielGrenehed/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/arm/hs22k).

## Version 2
A version 2 of the HS22K may or may not happen, I have however designed and built a 22 key split keyboard similar to this.

## More on this
I recently participated in the swedish programming podcast Kodsnack where I and Fredrik Bj√∂reman discussed my keyboard journey, the episode is in swedish and can be found [here](https://kodsnack.se/490/).
