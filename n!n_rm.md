## Running on the Nice!Nano (nrf52840)
Perform the following steps to program a precompiled example:

    * Download the latest repository file nRF5_SDK_x.x.x_xxxxxxx.zip (for example, nRF5_SDK_v17.1.0_1a2b3c4.zip) from nRF5 SDK product website.
    * Extract the zip file to the directory that you want to use to work with the SDK.
    * Connect the board to your computer with a USB cable. The computer will recognize it as a standard USB drive.
    * In the SDK directory, navigate to the example that you want to test and open the hex subdirectory. For example, for the Blinky Example, navigate to examples\peripheral\blinky\hex.
    * Select the HEX file that corresponds to your *development board* and copy it to the board USB drive.
